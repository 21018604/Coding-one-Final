# Manipulated vision

Tingting Peng - 21018604

## Introduction:

We entered a world of ecstasy. They manipulate, cajole and domesticate us, shaping an environment of panic and chaos. We are controlled nor are we in possession of cognitive...

The epidemic has brought the government into the zone of manipulating, cajoling and domesticating us, and we trust it to do what is right for us in a gentle and comfortable way. They manipulate information, lead us into a world of panic, and control our perceptions.

* I wanted to use the change of mouse position to show the control of an invisible hand over us.
* The use of sound to represent the government's control of the news and the homogenisation of information.
* The change in the direction of the eyes represents our numbness, our control, our lack of autonomy and awareness.
* The twitching of the eyes in response to the sound symbolises our sense of panic and helplessness in the world.

* Mouse to control the direction of the eye and the change of colour. -- The mouse represents the control of power and the eyes represent the person being controlled.

* The background colour changes randomly in response to the mouse. -- represents a world where we are in a panic and cannot change ourselves.

* The eyes twitch in response to the sound. -- The sound is the indoctrination of the rightful for us. The twitching of the eyes represents the panic of the people.


## Coding
Use the radial-gradient() function to give the background a radial gradient.

The position of the background image is fixed relative to the viewport when the content height is greater than the image height.
The background image is centred vertically and horizontally.

The @keyframes rule specifies the animation code and changes the style set. Changing the style happens. 0% animation starts and 100% animation finishes.

## Audio

The audio is a selection of two official news items and a panic-inducing and frightening sound. One is a news report from China and the other is a news report from a foreign country about China.

## Challenge
The biggest challenge for me was writing code that was logically flawed. A lot of the function usage was unfamiliar and led to a lot of problems in writing that could not be solved. I solved the problems I encountered by using the following methods.
1. Copy the problem into Google for reference.
2. Learn the functions that I don't know how to use or am not familiar with through w3school and Crash course again.
3. Sort out the logic by writing it down on paper.
4. Go to school and ask a teacher in the technical department.

## Result:

This semester has been very difficult for me, but I have learnt that it is very interesting to learn this course and I have gained a sense of achievement in solving problems and will continue to work hard to learn this language.
